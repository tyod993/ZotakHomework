# ZonarHomework
HI, Zonar!!!!!

This is the Android app that you requested from me. 
All of the features are there. I will keep working on it when I have time to
make it better. I plan to fix the problem posed in the Homework itself. 
Seperate the user and the Admin actions.

I tried to stick to the MVVM Architecture as much as possible.

The main libraries I used were:
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- ViewBinding
- RecyclerView

Due to the simplicity of the app I decided not to use things like 
Navigation, or DataBinding as they dont bring much value at this scale.

Given more time I would have liked to build in the last feature as 
well as creating a REST endpoint for the app to talk to. 

I would love your feedback on the app!
