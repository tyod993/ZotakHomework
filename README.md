# ZotakHomework
HI, Zotak!!!!!

This is the Android app that you requested from me. 
This week has been very busy with me as 4 of the people in my family all have birthdays 
within 4 days. Due to that I wasn't able to get to the third feature on the list. I did
build the majority of the functionality into the existing code. 

I tried to stick to the MVVM Architecture as much as possible.

The main libraries I used were:
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- ViewBinding
- RecyclerView

Due to the simplicity of the app I decided not to use things like 
Navigation, or DataBinding as they dont bring much value at this scale.

Given more time I would have liked to build in the last feature as 
well as creating a REST endpoint for the app to talk to. 

I would love your feedback on the app!
